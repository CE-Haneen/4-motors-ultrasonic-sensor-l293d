# 4-motors-ultrasonic-sensor-l293d

## Task 1: 4 DC Motors Control with L293D and Arduino UNO
This task demonstrates controlling 4 DC motors using 2 L293D motor driver ICs connected to an Arduino UNO. The motors perform a set of pre-programmed movements based on timing and direction control.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Using 4 DC motors with L293D to perform:
1. Forward movement for 30 seconds  
2. Backward movement for 60 seconds  
3. Alternating between right and left turns for 60 seconds

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- 4 Ã— DC Motors  
- 2 Ã— L293D Motor Driver ICs  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires  
- USB Power (or external 9V supply)
